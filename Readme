- Saved posts: Right now you pull in all posts and filter. This is NOT GOOD. 
    Lets change the DB to save an array of the IDs of the posts saved. 
    Also make sure to send in the ID NOT as a string to do this correctly. 
    Then when we pull can we can populate that instead of pulling everything. 
- Add that you can change a pfp 
- When you click on username let it go to that profile 
- Add a date/time to the request service button. 


EASY/ SMALL:
- Post Details Screen: Let it show all the pictures for a post, not just one. (Right now it shows the first of the array)
